Article 29 CMR), subject to individual exceptions (see shipment order page 1). The Contractor has to provide evidence of such insurance (e.g., policies or else insurance certificate in Greek or English). Should such proof not be provided in accordance with the above requirements at least one (1) hour before the scheduled loading time, InterNova reserves the right, regardless of the occurrence of a loss, to obtain sufficient liability insurance coverage and to make a 3% deduction on the freight rate. The assertion of further damages remains unaffected.</div> <div>3. InterNova assumes that the Contractor holds all necessary transport permits and furthermore carries such documentation in the truck cabin (EU-license, ECMT, etc.). In addition, the drivers engaged by the Contractor have all the necessary and valid permits (driver's license, ADR permit in the case of the shipments of hazardous goods, residence as well as work permit).</div> <div>4. The use of sub-carriers requires the express written permission of InterNova Trans. In the event of a breach of this instruction, the Contractor itself shall be liable for cases of damage to the same extent and will be charged with a penalty in the amount of EUR 10,000 plus VAT in addition to the damages incurred.</div> <div>5. Freight inquiries and orders of InterNova , are in no case to be advertised directly nor neutralized over freight exchanges. In the case of a breach, the Contractor will be charged a fee in the amount of EUR 1.500 plus VAT.</div> <div>6. Additional and trans-shipments are expressly prohibited. Any infringement will be treated as a total loss.</div> <div>7. In order to prevent damage and theft, the Contractor shall solely make use of parking places that are under surveillance. The truck has to be specifically secured against theft. The handover of the cargo can only occur with the recipient named by InterNova - any change requires the prior written approval of InterNova.</div> <div>8. The above dates (loading-/unloading times) are fixed dates and are binding. In the case that a contractor negligently or intentionally violates these deadlines, the contractor must pay InterNova a contractual penalty to the amount of the losses that have been incurred and proven by InterNova. This contractual penalty is due immediately. Furthermore, InterNova reserves the right to offset the penalty for the transportation rate, if required. Further claims for loss or damage shall remain unaffected.</div> <div>9. The contract stipulates the unit-based transfer and delivery of shipments by the driver. In the event of any conflict in the handover, InterNova must be informed immediately.</div> <div>10. Any loads transported by the vehicle will be safe for traffic, in particular in compliance with permissible axle loads, as well as securing of goods with lashing straps and cordons and are the responsibility of the Contractor or driver. Any costs or delays resulting from failure to observe this instruction shall be borne by the Contractor.</div> <div>11.

Obligation in the case of damage The Contractor must immediately notify InterNova and insurer in writing, in the event of damage or compensation claim raised against contractor. Any damage expected to exceed the amount of EUR 3.000 or for which the amount can not be estimated reliably, a competent accident commissioner, where applicable appoint by the insurer, will be commissioned without delay to assess the damage and whos instructions must be followed strictly. All costs for and associated with the commissioner shall be borne by the contractor. Each traffic accident or theft has to be reported immediately to the local police authority.

Pallet Exchange Euro pallets or E-PAL pallets must be replaced immediately. In case palettes are not replaced immediately, a deadline to return the palettes of a maximum of 14 days is stipulated. Failure to comply with this deadline will result in the Contractor being billed EUR 13,00 plus VAT per piece plus an administration fee of EUR 15,00 plus VAT. A replacement after the deadline has expired is not possible and will therefore not be accepted. Any replacement of pallets, including the non-replacement has to be demonstrated by appropriate documentation. The pallet notes that are issued by the driver are only valid with the stamp and signature of the consignor or recipient of the goods. Remarks on the CMR-waybill must likewise be countersigned by whoever is involved in the replacement of the pallets; a verbal confirmation on its own is insufficient. Invoices related to pallets are due immediately. Furthermore, InterNova reserve the right to retain and offset pallet costs against freight rate payments, if required.
